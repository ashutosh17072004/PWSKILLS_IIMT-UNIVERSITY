    "Solution (5): In Python, you cannot create an instance of an abstract class directly. An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and is meant to be subclassed by other classes. Abstract classes are created using the abc module in Python, and they often include abstract methods, which are methods that must be implemented by any concrete (non-abstract) subclass.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Abstract Methods: Abstract classes may have abstract methods, which are methods without a body. These methods are meant to be implemented by concrete (non-abstract) subclasses. Since the abstract class itself doesn't provide an implementation for these methods, it doesn't make sense to create an instance of the abstract class.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Incomplete Implementation: Abstract classes often serve as a blueprint for other classes. They may provide some common functionality but leave certain methods abstract, expecting concrete subclasses to implement those methods to suit their specific needs. Because of this incomplete implementation, instances of abstract classes would lack necessary functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code defines an abstract base class called “Polygon” using the ABC (Abstract Base Class) module in Python. The “Polygon” class has an abstract method called “noofsides” that needs to be implemented by its subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four subclasses of “Polygon” defined: “Triangle,” “Pentagon,” “Hexagon,” and “Quadrilateral.” Each of these subclasses overrides the “noofsides” method and provides its own implementation by printing the number of sides it has.\n",
    "\n",
